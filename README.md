# True Statements

This repo is experimental, I have a vague sense of where it is going, but for
now it is a sandbox.

This is a collection of true statements, organized loosely by category. When
learning any new field, there tend to be no limit to the ideas that are
sometimes true. When every fact is uncertain, learning becomes a trek through
high dimensional space, which, for those of us who are in the habit of thinking
in high dimensions, is very frustrating.

True statements reduce the dimensionallity of the learning problem. They are
little building blocks we crystallize from the chaos of words in a book. Even
if we are not certain of them, they can act as hypotheses against which we
compare future data. That said, perhaps it is not even best to think of them as
"true statements", rather they are simple statements. The value of a statement
is measured in how much it prunes the learning tree (if you get my drift).

Here is an example of a useful set of statements:

 1. All lifeforms have DNA
 2. Viruses are not lifeforms by definition
 3. Some viruses do not contain DNA
 4. All viruses contain DNA or RNA

I also want to describe the relationships between things, i.e. the structure of
a knowledge system. For example:

 1. Baysian and Frequentist statistics are two major schools of thought
